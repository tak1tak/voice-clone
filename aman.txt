hey people uh aman here
so given the current situation of the
world uh vaccines are going on obviously
in india
uh above 18 vaccines are already up but
the problem that we all have been facing
is that you can register but you cannot
find a slot
open for the vaccine and every single
time you have to check for that you have
to register
like you have to log in again through
the odb and we all know how the otp
system
went on last time and you have to check
for slot again and again
so i was initially planning of uh
planning to make a python program
and i was supposed to teach how the
python program would work to figure out
the vaccination slots and everything
but then i figured that i could directly
use the api
and i could directly show it to you guys
about how it works and it's actually
more easier
to uh like you know show how it works
okay
so let's get into that before that i
just have a small announcement to make
we
have our own telegram channel easterly
telegram channel
so we have you know technology stuff
apps and
you know general news and all that stuff
so
once again make sure you uh like
register on the telegram channel if you
have a telegram account
the link will be in the description
every other links which we use
will also be in the degree description
so let's just get started
okay so for this uh you will need a
browser
obviously and internet okay and the
first thing that you're gonna need is in
your chrome browser or brave browser
whatever browser you use
you need to download this extension json
formatter
now if you do not have this extension
the data is not going to make sense and
you're going to have a really tough time
you know figuring out what is what so
make sure you get this extension
link is in the description okay next
there are some apis provided by the
government
by the indian government and we will be
using those apis to figure out
uh the data like we'll be figuring out
what vaccination slots are open
what vaccines are provided what is the
current limit of the vaccine like you
know what's
the amount of people they can handle and
all that stuff so
this is the url it's api c2 dot
gov dot in slash public slash api slash
coven
okay so once again once you show up on
this page
there's a lot of stuff it might be
overwhelming
do not get over once again it's like
super easy stuff and
api is basically uh it's like you are
making a request
to a specific application and you are
getting a response back that's all an
api is if you think about it so
for this api what we'll be doing is uh
that
let's just start with the states or the
api okay it just makes more sense
so we'll go to this api and you have to
click on try it out so you'll get a link
if you click on execute this is the link
that you get so
if you copy this link and then you open
up a new tab paste it and enter
you get a list of all these states okay
this is the
like all the states that we have in uh
india plus the union territories
and uh if you do not have the json
formatter this is how the data will look
and it's messy so json formatter
obviously makes
things really easy for you and you can
also like you know do this
which is easier so i'll just focus on
gujarat because
i live in gujarat so we'll see the state
id for gujarat is 11.
so we'll just remember that we'll come
back here
uh we found the states now we need the
districts
all the districts available in that
state so we'll just click on try
and then we'll click on execute so we
can get this link so this is our request
url we're going to copy
open a new tab and enter now obviously
this is
for state id 16 uh whatever state id 16
that is karnataka we don't need it for
karnataka i'm gonna search for gujarat
so that would be 11.
guys make sure that you are changing
this the last
part of the url i'm going to hit enter
and now we have all the districts
present
in gujarat okay
and so on let's try for m
okay so now you have to focus on
district id because this stuff
this is more important so this is what
we'll be using in the next
api okay so it's district id 154
now if there are okay let's not get
ahead of ourselves
uh okay now if you show up there are
some options so it
it says find by district and then there
is calendar by district
now calendar by district just gives you
you know the
vaccination sessions by district for
seven days
now you can either go with that or you
can just go by
like you know find by district uh you're
gonna click on try
out and you're gonna click on execute
also there's stuff here you can edit it
from here if you want but
i just find that the url is super easy
copy
and then paste now this is for
five and two i don't know what district
that is i think that's for
a district alvarez rajasthan yeah okay
so obviously we're going to change the
district id so let's see what was the
district id for amdavad
154. so we're going to change this to
154 and we're gonna also change the date
obviously so today's date when i'm
recording this it's 8th
may so i'm gonna change that may is the
fifth
month and enter so this is what you get
you get all the information for
m area so now okay this might look
really like you know oh my god what is
this well there's so many stuff
so that is why we use json formatter so
sessions here just means that it's
different places in ahmedabad
where you can get the vaccine okay so
for example
this might be the first place uh then
this might be the second place
and so on and so forth so these are
sessions so what you can do is you can
you know try to combine them
like you know sorry collapse them in
like this
and it might be easier now if let's say
you want to find a specific
place and uh like how would you like go
through this data
once again it's like super easy you just
do ctrl
f and you just search for whatever
station you like whatever center you
want so
that's how it works also let's now try
to understand the information given
inside
okay so the first center id uh it's
id they have i don't know why it's
nothing it's not of
use to us the name of the station
the address state name gujarat obviously
a district name amdavad block name
baula pin code is given now
if you notice here you can also search
by pin code
okay find by pin uh if we'll just go
through that
if that is what you are into go ahead
it's super easy you just have to change
the pin code if you don't want to do the
pin one
thing okay so you can just come here
i'll just try for my pin code
and i'll just change the date to today
in my experience the pin code thing
sometimes works sometimes
doesn't so just go through the district
thing it's much more easier
and it gives you consistent results okay
so where wherever yeah
so pin code it shows you the pin code it
shows you the time so it's
morning nine to evening five it gives
you latitude and longitude i think
that's
really approximate uh uh it gives you a
fee type if the vaccine costs anything
it's free
uh there's the date session id once
again we have it's not
of use to us available capacity that is
46
fee is zero obviously it's free
uh minimum age limit is 45 so now if you
want to search it
for like you know above 18
one thing you can just do is just put 18
here
and obviously it will give you the like
you know the time
18 sometimes but i think it's easier to
just pass through this and just check
where's the minimum age limit and uh
apparently there isn't huh
apparently we don't have abu 18 uh
vaccines at this point
but see that this is why we are
searching okay so you can do
the same thing and you can do it for any
other district you want
and yeah that's it you just have this
information
now the calendar thing you can obviously
do that as well let's do calendar by pin
we're gonna try it out and we're gonna
execute so
we have this link we're gonna copy
paste oh i i think i did it
calendar by pin code let's do calendar
by district try it out
execute here we have our link
you open up a new tab and obviously
we'll have to change
uh what was the district 154
let's try amd about cooperation that's
770 right
770 and let's just put in today's date
so we can get like you know some idea of
the future
and five and enter let's see
okay so we have the same thing now
the thing that depends is like now you
have centers instead of
session and once you notice there's a
session and
inside that like for example there is a
center and inside that there are
different sessions okay so that will be
different dates
so for example this session uh
daria i hope i'm pronouncing that right
you have the data for eight and you have
the data for nine
then you show up for this center
and there's only one session apparently
then you
show up for kendra vidyalay then you
have a session for 8th and then 9th
and so on and so forth i think it's
because of saturday and sunday i might
be wrong
but yeah so the more you search you'll
kind of figure it out
so yeah basically that's it uh i hope
this made sense once again if you want
me to make a python program for this
it's really not a big deal apparently
you just have to like you know get this
data and then
parse it that's it that's what this
extension is doing apparently
so yeah python program would just
basically it will just ask you for the
details and it will just you know give
you
the output in a really nice form that's
it but you will have to run the python
program on your system natively
so there's that issue but yeah that's it
i hope this vaccination tracker thingy
works for you
and yeah that's it
